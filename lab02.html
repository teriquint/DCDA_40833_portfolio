            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>For this lab, I evaluated two AI tools from different categories that I feel represent different stages of data analytics. I used ChatGPT to evaluate coding help that could be used for data analysis and Canva for data presentation and graphics. I chose these tools because I feel that these two tools are representative of the different ways AI can be used in data analytics processes.</p>

            <h2>Tool 1: ChatGPT</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>I used ChatGPT for coding support. I tested it by asking it to help with formatting issues in html as well as help in explaining existing coding. One of the biggest strengths of ChatGPT was the clarity it provided to me when explaining technical code. When I uploaded an error it would explain why the error occurred and then suggest a fix. This was very helpful because not only did it fix the code but it helped me to learn in real time. ChatGPT pretty much acts as a tutor and that helped me to better understand what I was doing rather than just moving past the problem or just giving me a flat answer.

            </p>ChatGPT worked best when I was clear and specific. When I included details such as the goal of the task, the responses were much more accurate and useful. Sometimes when I started off my prompts were vague and I received a list of possible solutions as an answer. This was difficult because since I was not familiar with the code I coud not drill down from the list which was the best coding to use. The answers were not incorrect but may not have been specifically what I was looking for.

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            </p>A good use case for ChatGPT is learning and troubleshooting during data analysis. It is especially helpful when you are stuck and need guidance to move forward. A poor use case would be cut and pasting the generated code into an assignment without understanding how it works. That approach could lead to errors and raise concerns about academic integrity. It can also lead you down a path of different coding than what you are learning or working with at that time. 
            
            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>Ethical concerns with ChatGPT include rusting the output and only using it for "answers" versus actual learning. It is fairly easy for users to just rely on AI for a quick answer but this does not help learning and you end up cheating yourself by not developing your own understanding of the material.</p>
