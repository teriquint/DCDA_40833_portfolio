            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>For this lab, I evaluated two AI tools from different categories that I feel represent different stages of data analytics. I used ChatGPT to evaluate coding help that could be used for data analysis and Canva for data presentation and graphics. I chose these tools because I feel that these two tools are representative of the different ways AI can be used in data analytics processes.</p>

            <h2>Tool 1: ChatGPT</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>I used ChatGPT for coding support. I tested it by asking it to help with formatting issues in html as well as help in explaining existing coding. One of the biggest strengths of ChatGPT was the clarity it provided to me when explaining technical code. When I uploaded an error it would explain why the error occurred and then suggest a fix. This was very helpful because not only did it fix the code but it helped me to learn in real time. ChatGPT pretty much acts as a tutor and that helped me to better understand what I was doing rather than just moving past the problem or just giving me a flat answer.

            </p>ChatGPT worked best when I was clear and specific. When I included details such as the goal of the task, the responses were much more accurate and useful. Sometimes when I started off my prompts were vague and I received a list of possible solutions as an answer. This was difficult because since I was not familiar with the code I coud not drill down from the list which was the best coding to use. The answers were not incorrect but may not have been specifically what I was looking for.

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            </p>A good use case for ChatGPT is learning and troubleshooting during data analysis. It is especially helpful when you are stuck and need guidance to move forward. A poor use case would be cut and pasting the generated code into an assignment without understanding how it works. That approach could lead to errors and raise concerns about academic integrity. It can also lead you down a path of different coding than what you are learning or working with at that time. 
            
            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>Ethical concerns with ChatGPT include rusting the output and only using it for "answers" versus actual learning. It is fairly easy for users to just rely on AI for a quick answer but this does not help learning and you end up cheating yourself by not developing your own understanding of the material.</p>

            <h2>Tool 2: Canva</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
             </p>I used Canva to explore how AI supports data presentation. I focused on Canva Magic Studio features like magic studio backgrund eraser and background generator as well as graphic creation. Canva performed well when removing a background. I did find that uploading a very high quality image returned better results. I feel like Canva could distinguish between the photo and the background more crisp when the photo was high quality.The graphic creation worked well when I provided specific prompts for the type of graphic I wanted. It did have a hard time fine tuning colors and adding more than one photo but the template generated was a good start.

             </p>One of Canva’s biggest strengths is generating graphics and flyers when there is not already an uploaded photo to work with. Designing completely from scratch to help with the generation of ideas was where it worked best. Users that do not have any formal design training would benefit from Canva's AI features when it comes to design. However, Canva struggled when asked to maintain the quality or accuracy of an uploaded image. When incorporating the design it would change the original colors and morph facial features. It seems to me that the AI features are pretty new because I noticed there were several error messages that I kept running into in regards to features that had not yet been implemented.

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            </p>A good use case for Canva would be graphic or marketing presentations, not data presentaion. It works well for infographics such as mailers or flyers. A poor use case would be complex data visualizations that require precise representation of data. Canva's AI tools are not yet sophisticated enough to handle detailed data visualization accurately. 
            
            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            </p>Ethical concerns with Canva include originality and accuracy. I noticed that it was not pulling photos of what I had asked it to. It pulls pretty generic photos for fear of running into copyright issues. A few times, it also gave me an error because the AI wants to stay neutral politically and socially. I believe this could lead to AI generated templates having a similar feel. There would be a risk of originality if everyone is using the same AI generated templates.</p>
