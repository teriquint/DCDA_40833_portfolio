            <h2>Visualization Analysis and Connection</h2>
            
            <p>The infographic that stood out to me was entitled “Far More Unites Us Than Divides Us” from Beautiful News. I feel strongly about the polarization that exists in our country. My daughter works in Washington DC and sometimes saying that brings a mixed reaction. People hear it and instantly form opinions about what that means for that interaction or what I may stand for. I often feel the need to explain it. I often explain her work as changing the world to make it a better place. I feel that it sounds positive and something that we can all identify with wanting, just like this infographic displays.</p> 

            <p>The data writeup regarding this infographic explains how a visual such as this that is written about similarities rather than differences is rare and that is why I resonate with it so much. We are living in a very polarized time, but I also believe most people want the same things in life. We all prioritize safety and a good future for our children and grandchildren. Where people tend to split is not on the agreement of these goals, but on how they think those goals should be reached. I spend a lot of time talking to people about the importance of standing up for your beliefs, and I have consistently been able to connect with people regardless of party, religion, age, etc. Even though those conversations do not always end in agreement across the board they do often end in understanding.</p> 
        
            <p> All of these experiences line up with the message of this infographic, which suggests that similarities are more common than differences when you look past surface level conflicts. In a past course, I focused my main project on hate crimes. I looked at how much progress was made in the 1960s and how it feels like we are moving backwards now. What surprised me most was the responses I received. I had to present the project six times to small groups of four until I reached the entire class. Each time people were open and engaged and even felt comfortable sharing their thoughts with me. It reinforced my belief that when difficult topics are approached without extremes, people are willing to listen. The kind of polarization we see amplified on social media does not match what I experience in real conversations. I believe that this infographic displays that message pretty clearly and it is a message that I feel is important to share.</p>
            
            <h2>Critique</h2>
            
            <h3>Clarity Through Positive Emphasis</h3>

            <p>This belief is also what makes this infographic most powerful to me. The research behind it shows that similarities across groups often exceed 90 percent, even when differences are statistically significant. It is so refreshing to concentrate the positives across all of the different categories. The visualization that you achieve from the infographic makes the information very easy to understand and almost makes it simplistic. From a Tufte perspective, the design does more toward persuasion and simplicity than being data rich. The message is very clear, but there is not a lot of depth and it leaves you wanting to dig further into the data. There are areas within the curves where you can detect where the areas overlap. However, what we do not see is where similarities are the strongest and where they are the weakest. The data writeup is does explain that similarities and differences need to be understood together. If you want to see the whole story it is hard to understand one side without understanding the other.</p>

            <h3>Unanswered Questions in the Data</h3>

            <p>Examining the infographic through Tufte’s idea of information resolution does leave us with a story that is not very complete. When looking at the visualization it would be informative to know where the similarities are stronger and where they are not. We would also want to examine if there are any pattern changes depending on the topics or categories. Showing the data with a bit more layering or even more details by category could add more resolution and answer a bigger story while still keeping the graphic visually appealing.</p>

            <h3>Interpreting Results Beyond the Graphic</h3>

            <p>Since this infographic is more focused on the result, I did find it beneficial to know more information about what groups were being examined in more detail. However, once more data is known, I did find myself drawing my own conclusions or explanations and not sticking to the positive aura of the graphic which was to display a positive outcome with a positive visual for us to enjoy.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>Overall, some of my other concerns were not having a lot of information on the graphic regarding what was causing the positive effects. It showed us a positive conclusion but it did not leave much room for other interpretation. From Tufte’s perspective, the graphic is persuasive and does speak to your emotions, but it restricts the viewer because the dataset presented is very basic and limited even though the feelings and emotions are big.</p>
